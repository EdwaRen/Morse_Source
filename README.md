Application to communicate in real-time via morse code using a Firebase database. A unique 'stealth' mode can be enabled to only receive messages via phone vibrations and send messages via the up and down volume buttons

Functionality almost finished but still needs an aesthetic overhaul and more testing to prevent crashes.
